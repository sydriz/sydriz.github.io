It can be a solid form like a candy bar or it can be in a liquid form like hot chocolate. The taste of chocolate is often described as sweet because chocolate makers usually add a lot of sugar and milk for taste. 
This means that chocolate can be bad for your teeth and health. It is best to eat chocolate in moderation.</font></p>
